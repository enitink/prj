Hi Nitin,

Lo aaj kuch C ke programs banane ke liye de raha hoon try karo agar nahin bana to bolna solution de doonga.

1.   Write a program to sort the given N numbers using a single loop.

2.   Develop a function called convert(int no, int base) which prints the number in the base of base. Hojayega!!

3.   Write a program to print the second largest element in the unsorted array. (Note- the array not to be in the sorted order and you don't have to sort the nos.) Hojayega!

4.   Write a program to find the sum of the 2 nos which contain more than 20 digits. Hojayega.

5.   Write a program to print your name on the screen in that program you don't have to use the semicolon( ; ) and the double quotes( "  " ).


Try to solve these ones.
I think these are the some new programs that you haven't see these.

Also tell me this program is for what

# include<stdio.h>
# include<conio.h>
void main( )
{
      int n,i=2;
      printf ( " Enter the no :-  " ) ;
      scanf ( "%d", &n );
      while ( n % i ) i++ ;
      if ( n == i ) printf ( " Yes " );
      else printf ( " No " );
}

I think i surely get some answers from you.

Best of Luck

Take Care 
-Bye
