/*A long array A[] is given to you. There is a sliding window of size w which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the w numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves rightwards by one position. Following is an example:
The array is [1 3 -1 -3 5 3 6 7], and w is 3.*/
